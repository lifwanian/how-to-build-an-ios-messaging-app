# Implement 1-on-1 Messaging

1-on-1 messaging needs two users. JIVER identifies each user with User ID. The sample project provides the feature for messaging which the user can choose another user for obtaining ID of the user in the open chat channel.

## Start messaging

You need opponent's user ID in order to start 1-on-1 messaging. Each message in open chat has the sender's user ID. We will use it for messaging.

Open **OpenChatChattingViewController.m** in Xcode.
